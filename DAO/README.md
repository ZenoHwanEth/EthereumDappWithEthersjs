## WHAT IS DAO ?

> DAO stands for **D**ecentralized **A**utonomous **O**rganization. It is similar to companies 
> to real word. DAOs allow members to vote and make decision on the company. The process is democratized,
> and any member can make proposal and vote on it. DAO membership is either based on by the ownership of NFTS 
> or ERC20 tokens. Example of DAO based on tokens are [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) and [ENS](https://ens.domains/).
> Example of DOA based on NFTs include [Meebits DAO](https://www.meebitsdao.world/)
